# Project Description

Team Walsruw2 is creating a platform that allows users create a feedback form.
This project is going to be one that allows users to set up questionnaires, send them out, collect the data from the questionnaires sent out and group the result in sections.

The feedback generation platform also helps you get direct answers from your users. It wil help you answer questions about how your customers feel, such as;
Do visitors trust our site?
Are we getting them the information they need?
is our site visually appealing?
Are visitors returning to our site?
Are we making visitors feel safe on our site?.
